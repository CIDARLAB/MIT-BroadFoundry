#DNAplotlib

DNAplotlib is a computational toolkit that enables highly customizable visualization of individual genetic constructs and libraries of design variants. Publication quality vector-based output is produced and all aspects of the rendering process can be easily customized or replaced by the user. DNAplotlib is capable of SBOL Visual compliant diagrams in addition to a format able to better illustrate the precise location and length of each genetic part. This alternative visualization method enables direct comparison with nucleotide-level information such as RNA-seq read depth. While it is envisaged that access will be predominantly via the programming interface, an easy to use text-based input format that can be processed by a command-line script is also provided to facilitate broader usage. 

##Installation
The DNAplotlib library is contained within the `dnaplotlib.py` file. To install add the location of this file to your `PYTHONPATH` and you are good to go with:

``import dnaplotlib``
