TODO list for dnaplotlib
========================

MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR VER 1.0
---------------------------------

1. Fully documented and working dnaplotlib.py file (covers, all SBOL symbols, regulation and traces)
2. Tutorial on using library and basic data types
3. CSV input script for SBOL output
4. Very basic website that will allow for CSV script to be run.


OUTSTANDING
-----------

- [TG] Take a FASTA file and a list of parts (including their sequence and style to be drawn) and generate plasmid diagram (not for initial release).

- [TG] Final SBOL icons (ensure full compliance).

- [BD] Read SBOL file format to generate image, write SBOL file specifying the 'DnaComponents'.  Low priority.

- [TG] PyDocs everywhere to generate documentation for API.

- [TG,BD] Add regulation features.

- [BD] Option to label a part with the part name.

- [BD] Automatic generation of all state diagrams of circuit regulation?

- [EG] Test SBOL figure elements (create some basic diagrams with all parts, see "gallery").

- [EG] ORM for integration with other tools in lab (less important at moment).

- [EG,BD would like to help] Web-based interface for file input and PDF/PNG output.

- [EG] Short tutorial/user guide for web-interface.

- [TG,EG,BD] Basic user guide to help people getting started. Some tutorials.

- [TG,EG,BD] Gallery of examples covering constructs, circuits, other functionality.

- [TG,EG,BD] Bioinformatics paper (speak with Chris about publication). Wait until working, draft in online.

- [TG] Final home for the code. Maybe create Voigt lab GitHub Repo? Speak to Chris.
