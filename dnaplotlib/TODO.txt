TODO list for dnaplotlib
========================

After some thought, unless we can get a website done in next couple weeks we should treat as seperate project
and make a nice tool for building constructs visually. That is not the goal of this library so lets keep the
scope of this confined to a framework to build such tools on top of.

MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR VER 1.0
---------------------------------

1. Fully documented and working dnaplotlib.py file (covers, all SBOL symbols, regulation and traces)
2. Tutorial on using library and basic data types
3. CSV input script for SBOL output
4. Full SBOL Visual compliance (inc. the weird symbols)

OUTSTANDING
-----------

- [TG] Take a FASTA file and a list of parts (including their sequence and style to be drawn) and generate plasmid diagram (not for initial release).

- ***[TG] Final SBOL icons (ensure full compliance).

- [BD] Read SBOL file format to generate image, write SBOL file specifying the 'DnaComponents' (not for initial release).

- ***[TG] PyDocs everywhere to generate documentation for API.

- [BD] Automatic generation of all state diagrams of circuit regulation?

- [EG] ORM for integration with other tools in lab (less important at moment).

- [EG,BD would like to help] Web-based interface for file input and PDF/PNG output.

- [EG] Short tutorial/user guide for web-interface.

- ***[TG,EG,BD] Basic user guide to help people getting started. Some tutorials.

- ***[TG,EG,BD] Bioinformatics paper (speak with Chris about publication). Wait until working, draft in online.

- ***[TG] Final home for the code. Maybe create Voigt lab GitHub Repo? Speak to Chris.


COMPLETED
---------

- [TG,BD] Add regulation features.

- ***[TG] Add ability to show transcriptional traces and plot space correct symbols

- ***[TG] Option to label a part with the part name.

- [EG] Test SBOL figure elements (create some basic diagrams with all parts, see "gallery").

- ***[TG,EG,BD] Gallery of examples covering constructs, circuits, other functionality.
