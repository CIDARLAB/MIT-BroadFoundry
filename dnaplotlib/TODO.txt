- [TG,BD] Add regulation features.

- [BD] Option to label a part with the part name.

- [BD] Automatic generation of all state diagrams of circuit regulation?

- [EG] Test SBOL figure elements (create some basic diagrams with all parts, see "gallery").

- [EG] ORM for integration with other tools in lab (less important at moment).

- [EG,BD would like to help] Web-based interface for file input and PDF/PNG output.

- [EG] Short tutorial/user guide for web-interface.

- [TG,EG,BD] Basic user guide to help people getting started. Some tutorials.

- [TG,EG,BD] Gallery of examples covering constructs, circuits, other functionality.

- [TG,EG,BD] Bioinformatics paper (speak with Chris about publication). Wait until working, draft in online.

- [TG] Final home for the code. Maybe create Voigt lab GitHub Repo? Speak to Chris.
