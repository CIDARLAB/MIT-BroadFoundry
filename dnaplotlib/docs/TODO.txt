TODO list for dnaplotlib
========================

Simple interface for animated plots (add_frame like method with updated construct or styling). Incorporating built-in encoding to video would also be great, but I am unsure if a “pure” Python implementation is available.

Standardised way of connecting attributes to performance data. Maybe we could have a class of converter that will style elements in an appropriate way given some “strength” or other attribute from experiment. This way the design and converter can remain fixed, but the experimental data will style the output.

Comparative expression example (using ideas from previous point). Using the circuit data we can use Tx to compare the state of components within the design.

Annotated graphs. Ability to use genetic constructs to annotate existing graphs or even form the points of a graph (useful to help understand design spaces that are explored by iterations of the library creation).
Potential packaging for standard online repository. This would make installation much easier.












MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR VER 1.0
---------------------------------

1. (DONE) Fully documented and working dnaplotlib.py file (covers, all SBOL symbols, regulation and traces)
2. (DONE) CSV input script for SBOL output
3. (DONE) Full SBOL Visual compliance (inc. the weird symbols)
4. (DONE) Basic web interface for uploading files, generating simple constructs

VERSION 1.1
-----------

1. New part types (recombinases, protein tags)
2. TBA


OUTSTANDING
-----------

NEEDED FOR RELEASE


FOR LATER...

- [TG] Take a FASTA file and a list of parts (including their sequence and style to be drawn) and generate plasmid diagram (not for initial release).

- [BD] Read SBOL file format to generate image, write SBOL file specifying the 'DnaComponents' (not for initial release).

- [BD] Automatic generation of all state diagrams of circuit regulation?


COMPLETED
---------

- [TG] Final home for the code. Maybe create Voigt lab GitHub Repo? Speak to Chris. (worry about at publication)

- [EG] ORM for integration with other tools in lab (less important at moment).

- [EG,BD would like to help] Web-based interface for file input and PDF/PNG output.

- ***[TG] PyDocs everywhere to generate documentation for API.

- [TG] Spacing is messed up on some elements. Make sure that there is no overlap with default settings.

- [TG,BD] Add regulation features.

- ***[TG] Add ability to show transcriptional traces and plot space correct symbols

- ***[TG] Option to label a part with the part name.

- [EG] Test SBOL figure elements (create some basic diagrams with all parts, see "gallery").

- ***[TG,EG,BD] Gallery of examples covering constructs, circuits, other functionality.

- ***[TG] Final SBOL icons (ensure full compliance).
