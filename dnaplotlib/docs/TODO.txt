TODO list for dnaplotlib
========================

After some thought, unless we can get a website done in next couple weeks we should treat as seperate project
and make a nice tool for building constructs visually. That is not the goal of this library so lets keep the
scope of this confined to a framework to build such tools on top of.


MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR VER 1.0
---------------------------------

1. (DONE) Fully documented and working dnaplotlib.py file (covers, all SBOL symbols, regulation and traces)
2. (DONE) CSV input script for SBOL output
3. (DONE) Full SBOL Visual compliance (inc. the weird symbols)


OUTSTANDING
-----------

NEEDED FOR RELEASE

- [EG,BD would like to help] Web-based interface for file input and PDF/PNG output.

- ***[TG] Final home for the code. Maybe create Voigt lab GitHub Repo? Speak to Chris.


FOR LATER...

- [EG] Short tutorial/user guide for web-interface.

- [TG] Take a FASTA file and a list of parts (including their sequence and style to be drawn) and generate plasmid diagram (not for initial release).

- [BD] Read SBOL file format to generate image, write SBOL file specifying the 'DnaComponents' (not for initial release).

- [BD] Automatic generation of all state diagrams of circuit regulation?

- [EG] ORM for integration with other tools in lab (less important at moment).


COMPLETED
---------

- ***[TG] PyDocs everywhere to generate documentation for API.

- [TG] Spacing is messed up on some elements. Make sure that there is no overlap with default settings.

- [TG,BD] Add regulation features.

- ***[TG] Add ability to show transcriptional traces and plot space correct symbols

- ***[TG] Option to label a part with the part name.

- [EG] Test SBOL figure elements (create some basic diagrams with all parts, see "gallery").

- ***[TG,EG,BD] Gallery of examples covering constructs, circuits, other functionality.

- ***[TG] Final SBOL icons (ensure full compliance).
